                In the year 2092, space is full of dangerous floating garbage
                like discarded satellites and deserted spaceships. The crew of a
                space junk collector ship called The Victory discovers a
                humanoid robot thatâ€™s known to be a weapon of mass destruction.
                They get involved in a risky business deal and travel through
                space looking for garbage they can make money off of while also
                competing with rival junk collectors.
